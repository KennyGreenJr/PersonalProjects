# Python Projects

## Introduction

Python is the third programming language I've learned, after SAS and R, respectively. At the outset, I solely used Python to compare statistical model output to SAS' model output. However, I transitioned to Python completely once corporations wanted to rely less on paid software and focus more on open-source languages.
